# Krunker-Io-Hack
Uninstall old versions of this and all tampermonkey scripts and follow instructions bellow.

# â™¿ 1.9.0 wheelchair
Become a cripple, use a wheelchair...

### Chromium Extension
Remove all exisiting scripts.

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Enable developer mode (probably a checkbox in the top right)
3. [Download this unpacked extension (click here)](https://github.com/ItsFelix/Krunker-Io-Hack/raw/master/wheelchair%201.9%20-%20no%20aimbot.zip)
4. Drag the downloaded zip into the extensions page

If you can figure out reliable ways to identify the presence of the extension running then I am interested to know how.

it's his script without the obvious aimbot!
